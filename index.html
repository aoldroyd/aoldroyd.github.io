                <p>
                    I am a software engineer based in Cambridge, specializing in the successful delivery of innovative
                    technologies within enterprise settings, particularly in regulated environments.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My experience extends beyond traditional software engineering,
                    encompassing insights, guidance, and strategic input for the implementation of new and emerging
                    technologies across diverse business functions. My hands-on experience includes directly
                    implementing numerous diverse technologies to develop Proof of Concepts, ensuring that the insights
                    I provide are not only strategic but also grounded in practical understanding. I collaborate and
                    form partnerships with external companies from small startups to the tech giants to understand where
                    technologies are going, and what new skills and capabilities are going to be needed to maximise the
                    impact and value of them within an organisation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm passionate about accelerating the adoption of innovative technologies, which means more than
                    just understanding the
                    benefits within the context of a proof of concept. I am capable of effectively
                    communicating with
                    strategic leaders, explaining the value of these technologies, and articulating potential risks to
                    drive successful and long-lasting value.

                        <strong>XR Projects</strong>
                        <br> Be it Virtual Reality, Augmented Reality or Spatial computing, eXtended Reality is starting
                        to become a focus within the enterprise. I've worked on numerous projects from leveraging VR for
                        training and building muscle memory with no risk to real equipment, through to the future of
                        work collaboration and metaverse solutions.

                        <strong>Digital Twins</strong>
                        <br> Digital Twins are gaining popularity for their potential to enhance efficiency and revolutionize operational processes. My recent projects go beyond creating a 3D visual twin with basic predictions. Instead, they explore innovative approaches to represent underlying data, aiming to develop holistic twins capable of autonomously managing future facilities given nothing but natural language prompts and context from real-time data.

                        <strong>Generative AI</strong>
                        <br> Generative AI is currently one of the most discussed technologies. In recent projects, I've concentrated on expanding its applications beyond the established domains of text and images, exploring the future possibilities of this innovative technology.

                    <li>
                        <strong>Portal Development</strong>
                        <br> Having insights and knowledge about new and emerging technologies is valuable, but without awareness, the impact of these insights is limited. I've been instrumental in developing a polished website designed to effectively deliver these insights to key strategic leaders.

                            <strong>Gaming</strong>
                            <br> I am an avid PC gamer with a deep passion for both casual and competitive games. While I don't have a specific genre preference, I am drawn to unique gaming experiences over sequels. Gaming has been a constant in my life, serving as a fantastic means to stay connected with friends regardless of physical distances.

                            <br> Beyond gaming, I dedicate time to creating my own digital experiences using Unity as my preferred engine. This not only satisfies my creative drive but also keeps me updated with the latest advancements in the real-time 3D space.
